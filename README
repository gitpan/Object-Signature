NAME
    Signature - Generate cryptographic signatures for objects

SYNOPSIS
      # In your module
      package My::Module
      use base 'Object::Signature';
  
      # In outside code
      my $Object = My::Module->new;  
      print "Object Signature: " . $Object->signature;

DESCRIPTION
    Object::Signature is an abstract base class that you can inherit from in
    order to allow your objects to generate unique cryptographic signatures.

    The method used to generate the signature is based on Storable and
    Digest::MD5. The object is fed to Storable::nfreeze to get a string,
    which is then passed to Digest::MD5::md5_hex to get a unique 32
    character hexidecimal signature.

METHODS
  signature
    The "signature" method is the only method added to your class, and will
    generate a unique 32 hexidecimal signature for any object it is called
    on.

TO DO
    Allow Object::Signature to interact correctly with classes that are
    already Storable subclasses, supporting their own Storable hooks.
